# Welcome to Zenith

Since there's not already millions of blogs and static site generators much better than mine out there, I decided to create my own using a static site generator that I built myself called **Zenith**.

## Why Another Static Site Generator?

Great question! The answer is simple: because I'm a developer, and we have an uncontrollable urge to reinvent the wheel whenever we encounter something that works perfectly fine.

I wanted something that was:
- **Fast** - Because waiting for builds is for people with patience
- **Simple** - No 47-step configuration processes or Phd in webpack required
- **Mine** - So when it breaks at 2 AM, I only have myself to blame

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will be my digital dumping ground for thoughts on:

- **Technology** - Hot takes on the latest frameworks that will be obsolete next week
- **Privacy** - Why your smart toaster probably knows more about you than your therapist
- **Home Automation** - Adventures in making my house smarter than me
- **Programming** - Code snippets, tutorials, and the occasional existential crisis about semicolons
- **General Rants** - Because sometimes you just need to vent about JavaScript frameworks and AI hype

## About Zenith

Zenith is built with TypeScript and focuses on simplicity and performance. It takes markdown files like this one, processes them through templates, and spits out a static site that loads faster than you can say "Javascript framework fatigue."
The whole thing is probably over-engineered for a simple blog, but where's the fun in doing things the easy way?

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing my experiences building Zenith, diving into various tech topics, and sharing my thoughts on the latest trends. If you're into that sort of thing, stick around!

Feel free to check out the [source code](https://github.com/woulve/zenith) if you want to see how it is made.
