# Welcome to Zenith

Hello and welcome to Zenith! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## About This Blog

This blog is built using a custom static site generator that I created with:

- **TypeScript** for the build system
- **SCSS** for styling
- **Markdown** for writing posts
- **HTML** templates for structure

## What You Can Expect

I'll be writing about various topics including:

- Web development
- Technology trends
- Personal projects
- Learning experiences

## The Design Philosophy

I believe in keeping things simple and focused. This blog follows a minimalistic design approach that prioritizes:

1. **Readability** - Clean typography and plenty of white space
2. **Performance** - Static HTML files for fast loading
3. **Simplicity** - No unnecessary features or distractions

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts!
